# Reactive Streams

![](./debug.gif)

- `Reactive Streams` is the specification    
- `Project Reactor` is the implementation   
- There are four components `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, `Subscription` and `Processor`

## Project Reactor

Project Reactor has two types of Publisher:

- `Flux:` Emit 0 to N elements
- `Mono:` Emit 1 or none element

> O Consumo sÃ³ inicia com o Subscriber

### Operators

> Operators are functions that emits elements from Publisher, 
>  for instance, a Flux, bellow we have some operators of it.  

`Flux.fromIterable` Emit elements from List<T>   
`Flux.map` Emit one element at a time to convert to other type of element   
`Flux.flatMap` Emit one element at a time to convert to other type of element   
`Flux.just` varags => Create a Flux that emits elements and then completes.      
`Flux.fromArray`   
`Flux.fromStream`   
`Flux.range`   
`Flux.range`      
`Mono.just` Create a Mono that emits one or none element and then complete it.   
   
### Flux Create Operator

> Programmatically create a Flux with the capability of emitting multiple elements in a synchronous or asynchronous manner through the FluxSink API. This includes emitting elements from multiple threads.
>  This Flux factory is useful if one wants to adapt some other multi-valued async API and not worry about cancellation and backpressure (which is handled by buffering all signals if the downstream can't keep up).

### Flux Create Generate

> Programmatically create a Flux by generating signals 
>  one-by-one via a consumer callback and some state. 
> The stateSupplier may return null.

There are two type of Operators, `Upstream` and `Downstream`. Upstream are operators that emits 
elements, as we saw above `just`, `fromIterable`, `fromStream`, `empty`, `defer`.    
Downstream we're going to start seeing now, but basically are operators that consumes the data emitted by any publisher.   
In summary, Downstream are subscribers and Upstream are publishers. 

The first Downstream operator will be the `take`.
