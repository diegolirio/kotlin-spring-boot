## Level 1

### Level 1 - Add.kt
https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-1/jwr339Kq6e3LQTsfa   
Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.    

**My Solution:**
> I used a BigDecimal because if you have the numbers with floating numbers. 

**Why did you think in this Solution:**
>  I thought in this solution because when we use BigDecimal, it guarantees
>  our calculation won't lost the precision theses the numbers.
>  for exemplo: 4.000006 + 3.4447382 = `could return a resulted wrong`

**You think it can have another solution:**
> A simple code would be a number plus other one, but it could be the error that I said before.
> How they are Int Numbers, alright if we use this way!

### Level 1 - CenturyFromYear.kt
https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-1/egbueTZRRL5Mm4TXN   
   
Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

**My Solution:**
> So the method receive a param whose the type is Int, and it is a year, firstly 
>  I check if the number is divisible by hundred, in other words if the remainder 
>  of the division is zero. Kotlin doesn't have a ternary operator, it has a if as a 
>  function which return a value, in this case it returns a Value-Int else another 
>  one (Also Int).

**Why did you think in this Solution:**
> That's a simple role, just one line I am able to resolve it. 

**You think it can have another solution:**
> Yes, But this way is simpler, right?!

### Level 1 - CheckPalindrome.kt
https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-1/egbueTZRRL5Mm4TXN

Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.

**My Solution:**
> Palindrome is a word that backwards is the same one. For example, eye, decaf faced.
>  So my solution was to do a loop for the string getting each character and
>  concatenating each letter of the loop with a first position of a new-string, 
>  this new-string in the concatenation is for last.

**Why did you think in this Solution:**
> I guess it is the simpler solution without using any framework or library.  

**You think it can have another solution:**
> No, I don't.

## Level 2

### Level 2 - AdjacentElementsProduct.kt 
https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/xzKiBHjhoinnpdh6m

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

**My Solution:**
> Ok, firstly I'll explain what is adjacent product. It is a pair normally 
>  in a array of elements, in this case they are Ints Elements. If we have 
>  a array containing  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, the adjacent products are (2,4), (4,6),
>  (6,8) and (8,10), now just we multiply them, for this example the largest is 80.
> In my solution method, I declared a variable named largest and I initialized it 
>  with the smallest possible value for a Integer, ensuring any number will be 
>  greater than this initial value. I have a "for" iterates the array until 
>  second-to-last element, and then I have a `product` variable storing a 
>  multiplication between the adjacent product, in other words the number and its next,
>  after storing the product to check the largest I have a if, so if the product is greater than current value,
>  largest store a new value, the same in product.

**Why did you think in this Solution:**
> It is a simple way to solve the largest adjacent product, using for-loop until 
>  second-to-last element of the array, right?!

**You think it can have another solution:**
> I don't know another solution, maybe programming language can be more performative.

### Level 2 - ShapeArea.kt
https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/yuGuHvcCaFCKk56rJ

Bellow we will define and `n`-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area 
 of a polygon for a given `n`.

A `1`-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length `1`. 
 An `n`-interesting polygon is obtained by talking the `n - 1`-interesting 
 polygon and appending `1`-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You 
 can see the `1`-, `2`-, `3`- and `4`-interesting polygons in the picture 
 on the link above. 

**My Solution:**
